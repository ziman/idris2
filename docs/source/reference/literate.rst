Literate Programming
**********************

Idris2 supports several types of literate mode styles.

The unlit'n has been designed based such that we assume that we are parsing markdown-like languages
The unlit'n is performed by a Lexer that uses a provided literate style to recognise code blocks and code lines.
Anything else is ignored.

A literate style consists of:

+ a list of String encoded code block deliminators;
+ a list of line indicators; and
+ a list of valid file extensions.

Lexing is simple and greedy in that when consuming anything that is a code blocks we treat everything as code until we reach the closing deliminator.
This means that use of verbatim modes in a literate file will also be treated as active code.

In future we should add support for literate ``LaTeX`` files, and potentially other common document formats.
But more importantly, a more intelligent processing of literate documents using a pandoc like library in Idris such as: `Edda <https://github.com/jfdm/edda>` would also be welcome.

Bird Style Literate Files
=========================

Bird notation is a classic literate mode found in Haskell, (and Orwell) in which code lines begin with ``>``.
Other lines are treated as documentation.

We treat files with an extension of ``.lidr`` as bird style literate files.

Embedding in Markdown-like documents
====================================

While Bird Style literate mode is useful, it does not lend itself well
to more modern markdown-like notations such as Org-Mode and CommonMark.

Idris2 also provides support for recognising both 'visible' and 'invisible'
code blocks and lines in both CommonMark and OrgMode documents.

'Visible' content will be kept in the pretty printer's output while
the 'invisible' blocks and lines will be removed.

OrgMode
*******

+ Org mode source blocks for idris are recognised as visible code blocks,
+ Comment blocks that begin with ``#+COMMENT: idris`` are treated as invisible code blocks.
+ Invisible code lines are denoted with ``#+IDRIS:``.

We treat files with an extension of ``.org`` as org-mode style literate files.

CommonMark
************

Only code blocks denoted by standard code blocks labelled as idris are recognised.

We treat files with an extension of ``.md`` and ``.markdown`` as CommonMark style literate files.
